#Project Task tracker

Its an idea I had when I was watching the "VueJS crash course" video by Brad Traversy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs&t=4286s)

The point is: a  task tracker app is a good way to learn the base concepts of a framework like vue , react or angular.
After completing the video I decided to remake the app first in React, to brush up on my react skills, and then in Angular to get the feel of the framework.
